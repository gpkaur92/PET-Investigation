    "Positron emission detector is a set of detectors that surrounds the object to be imaged and are designed to convert high energy gamma quanta to an electrical signal that can be further used for processing of data[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple coincidence detection system consists of a pair of radiation detectors with associated electronics and a coincidence circuit. Event will be recorded if annihilation occurs somewhere between two detectors and gamma quanta will ineract with each of them. Because all annihilation gamma quanta are emitted approximately 180° apart, a recorded coincidence indicates an annihilation occurred somewhere along the line connecting the two detectors. This line usually is referred to as a line of\n",
    "response or LOR. \n",

    "**Types of events:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1> *true coincidence* - would be recorded only events where the two detected annihilation gamma quanta originate from the same\n",
    "radioactive decay and have not changed direction or lost any energy before being detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2> *scattered coincidence* – one or both gamma quanta coming from annihilation interacts inside patient body what changes its\n",
    "direction and results in mispositioning of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "3> *random coincidence* - a coincidence is generated by two gamma quanta originating from two separate annihilations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4> *multiple coincidence* - three or more gamma quanta are detected excatly in the same time what results in the ambiguity of\n",
    "where to position the events[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "One can find point of annihilation lying on Line Of Response (LOR) which connects two opposite block detectors. To find actual\n",
    "position of radioactive atoms one could use time difference between arrival time of the two gamma quanta at the detectors. For\n",
    "annihilation closer to first detector arrival time will be smaller than for second detector. For annihilation exactly in the middle of LOR time difference will be equal to zero. "

    "**Q2_Concept of positron and how they are emitted:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A positron is a particle of matter with the same mass as an electron but an opposite charge. It is a form of antimatter because, when a positron encounters an electron, the two completely annihilate to yield energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The positron was discovered in 1933 by the American physicist Carl Anderson. Anderson was studying the cosmic rays particles with a Wilson chamber or cloud chamber. Steam condensed into fine droplets along the trajectory of electrically charged particles crossing the chamber, visualizing this trajectory. A magnetic field produced by a coil bent trajectories which allow to determine the sign, positive or negative, of the particle electric charge[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Some positrons are generated by a rare type of radioactive decays, beta-plus decays. The positron is produced together with a invisible neutrino-electron that escape detection. Energy is taken from the energy released in the decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second process is the simultaneous production of an electron and a positron during the interaction of an energetic gamma with a nucleus. As an electron is also produced, one should add 511 kev to the 511 kev needed to create the positron : the gamma energy should be larger than 1022 keV. Few natural gamma in radioactive decays have such energies. Pair production plays a marginal role in our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Einstein formula E = M c² relating mass and energy, it is possible to produce positrons with an energy greater than 511 kEv, the mass energy of the positron or electron. Quantum Mechanics allows ultra shorts transformations of a gamma into a pair of particle-antiparticle, such as an electron and a positron. If during this short instant, the pair finds itself in the vicinity of the strong electric field of a nucleus it interacts with it. The interaction with the nucleus enables the creation of the electron and positron to remain permanent. The \"mass energy\" (twice 511 keV) necessary for the formation of the two particles is taken from the energy of the gamma that must be must greater than a 1.022 MeV threshold[4]."

    "**Q3_Nuclear Medicine:**\n",

    "Nuclear medicine imaging uses small amounts of radioactive materials called radiotracers that are typically injected into the bloodstream, inhaled or swallowed. The radiotracer travels through the area being examined and gives off energy in the form of gamma rays which are detected by a special camera and a computer to create images of the inside of your body. Nuclear medicine imaging procedures are noninvasive and, with the exception of intravenous injections, are usually painless medical tests that help physicians diagnose and evaluate medical conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference in Nuclear medicine and Positron Emission Tomography:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1> Nuclear medicine is paticularly a radioactive material called as radiotracer or radiopharmaceutical, which are being inhaled as gas or swallowed whereas the technique which uses them as its first step is called positron emission tomography.\n",
    "\n",
    "2> Nuclear medicine gets accumulated in the body part which is to be examined where it gives small amount of energy as gamma rays special detectors detect this rays and further use them for diagnosis. The positron is a particle which is component of this rays and this technique is known as positron emission tomography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically this both are interrelated because PET itself is a type of nuclear medicine exam."

    "The low-molecular-weight PET radioisotopes (C-11, N-13, O-15, and F-18) are all produced by charged particle bombardment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the radioisotopes are produced in a cyclotron, although other charged particle accelerators can be used. The charged particles that are used are usually the nuclei of very low weight isotopes, hydrogen, deuterium, or helium. The hydrogen\n",
    "nucleus is a single proton; the deuterium nucleus is one proton and one neutron; and the helium nucleus is two protons and two neutrons.These very low molecular weight elements are converted to ions beforeinjection into a cyclotron. Stripping an electron from the atom can produce a positive ion. There has been an increasing use of negative ion sources, where an electron is added to a neutral atom. Although it is somewhat harder to produce negative ions, it turns out that negative ions make it easier to in extract the beam from a cyclotron. Two electrons can be stripped from a negative ion by passing it through a carbon foil producing a positive ion that then turns in a different direction in the magnetic field of the cyclotron, allowing the beam to be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "When accelerated to high energies, these charged particles can be smashed into nuclei of other elements. The high energy is used to overcome the electrical forces which keep the positively charge nuclei apart. After overcoming these forces, the nucleons can interact using nuclear forces to form new isotopes. Typically, a high-energy particle smashes into an isotope of an element and some other high-energy particle is emitted[5].\n",
